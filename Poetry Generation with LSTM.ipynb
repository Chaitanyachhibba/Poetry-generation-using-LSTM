       "'They come from everywhere\\nA longing to be free\\nThey come to join us here\\nFrom sea to shining sea And they all have a dream\\nAs people always will\\nTo be safe and warm\\nIn that shining city on the hill Some wanna slam the door\\nInstead of opening the gate\\nAw, let\\'s turn this thing around\\nBefore it gets too late \\nIt\\'s up to me and you\\nLove can conquer hate\\nI know this to be true\\nThat\\'s what makes us great \\nDon\\'t tell me a lie\\nAnd sell it as a fact\\nI\\'ve been down that road before\\nAnd I ain\\'t goin\\' back And don\\'t you brag to me\\nThat you never read a book\\nI never put my faith\\nIn a con man and his crooks I won\\'t follow down that path\\nAnd tempt the hands of fate\\nAw, let\\'s turn this thing around\\nBefore it gets too late \\nIt\\'s up to me and you\\nLove can conquer hate\\nI know this to be true\\nThat\\'s what makes us great In the quiet of the night\\nI lie here wide awake\\nAnd I ask myself\\nIs there a difference I can make? \\nIt\\'s up to me and you\\nLove can conquer hate\\nI know this to be true\\nThat\\'s what makes us great I come from down in the valley\\nWhere mister when you\\'re young\\nThey bring you up to do like your daddy done\\nMe and Mary we met in high school\\nWhen she was just seventeen\\nWe\\'d ride out of this valley down to where the fields were green\\nWe\\'d go down to the river\\nAnd into the river we\\'d dive\\nOh down to the river we\\'d ride Then I got Mary pregnant\\nAnd man that was all she wrote\\nAnd for my nineteenth birthday I got a union card and a wedding coat\\nWe went down to the courthouse\\nAnd the judge put it all to rest\\nNo wedding day smiles no walk down the aisle\\nNo flowers no wedding dress That night we went down to the river\\nAnd into the river we\\'d dive\\nOh down to the river we did ride I got a job working construction for the Johnstown Company\\nBut lately there ain\\'t been much work on account of the economy\\nNow all them things that seemed so important\\nWell mister they vanished right into the air\\nNow I just act like I don\\'t remember\\nMary acts like she don\\'t care But I remember us riding in my brother\\'s car\\nHer body tan and wet down at the reservoir\\nAt night on them banks I\\'d lie awake\\nAnd pull her close just to feel each breath she\\'d take\\nNow those memories come back to haunt me\\nThey haunt me like a curse\\nIs a dream a lie if it don\\'t come true\\nOr is it something worse\\nThat sends me down to the river\\nThough I know the river is dry\\nThat sends me down to the river tonight\\nDown to the river\\nMy baby and I\\nOh down to the river we ride The screen door slams, Mary\\'s dress waves\\nLike a vision she dances across the porch as the radio plays\\nRoy Orbison singing for the lonely\\nHey, that\\'s me and I want you only\\nDon\\'t turn me home again, I just can\\'t face myself alone again\\nDon\\'t run back inside, darling, you know just what I\\'m here for\\nSo you\\'re scared and you\\'re thinking that maybe we ain\\'t that young anymore\\nShow a little faith, there\\'s magic in the night\\nYou ain\\'t a beauty but, hey, you\\'re alright\\nOh, and that\\'s alright with me You can hide \\'neath your covers and study your pain\\nMake crosses from your lovers, throw roses in the rain\\nWaste your summer praying in vain\\nFor a savior to rise from these streets\\nWell now, I ain\\'t no hero, that\\'s understood\\nAll the redemption I can offer, girl, is beneath this dirty hood\\nWith a chance to make it good somehow\\nHey, what else can we do now?\\nExcept roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair\\nWell, the night\\'s busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere\\nWe got one last chance to make it real\\nTo trade in these wings on some wheels\\nClimb in back, heaven\\'s waiting on down the tracks Oh oh, come take my hand\\nWe\\'re riding out tonight to case the promised land\\nOh oh oh oh, Thunder Road\\nOh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road\\nLying out there like a killer in the sun\\nHey, I know it\\'s late, we can make it if we run\\nOh oh oh oh, Thunder Road\\nSit tight, take hold, Thunder Road Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk\\nAnd my car\\'s out back if you\\'re ready to take that long walk\\nFrom your front porch to my front seat\\nThe door\\'s open but the ride ain\\'t free\\nAnd I know you\\'re lonely for words that I ain\\'t spoken\\nBut tonight we\\'ll be free, all the promises\\'ll be broken There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away\\nThey haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets\\nThey scream your name at night in the street\\nYour graduation gown lies in rags at their feet\\nAnd in the lonely cool before dawn\\nYou hear their engines rolling on\\nBut when you get to the porch, they\\'re gone on the wind\\nSo Mary, climb in\\nIt\\'s a town full of losers, I\\'m pulling out of here to win I get up in the evening\\nAnd I ain\\'t got nothing to say\\nI come home in the morning\\nI go to bed feeling the same way\\nI ain\\'t nothing but tired\\nMan I\\'m just tired and bored with myself\\nHey there baby, I could use just a little help You can\\'t start a fire\\nYou can\\'t start a fire without a spark\\nThis gun\\'s for hire\\nEven if we\\'re just dancing in the dark Message keeps getting clearer\\nRadio\\'s on and I\\'m moving \\'round the place\\nI check my look in the mirror\\nI want to change my clothes, my hair, my face\\nMan I ain\\'t getting nowhere\\nI\\'m just living in a dump like this\\nThere\\'s something happening somewhere\\nBaby I just know that there is You can\\'t start a fire\\nYou can\\'t start a fire without a spark\\nThis gun\\'s for hire\\nEven if we\\'re just dancing in the dark You sit around getting older\\nThere\\'s a joke here somewhere and it\\'s on me\\nI\\'ll shake this world off my shoulders\\nCome on baby this laugh\\'s on me Stay on the streets of this town\\nAnd they\\'ll be carving you up alright\\nThey say you gotta stay hungry\\nHey baby I\\'m just about starving tonight\\nI\\'m dying for some action\\nI\\'m sick of sitting \\'round here trying to write this book\\nI need a love reaction\\nCome on now baby gimme just one look You can\\'t start a fire sitting \\'round crying over a broken heart\\nThis gun\\'s for hire\\nEven if we\\'re just dancing in the dark\\nYou can\\'t start a fire worrying about your little world falling apart\\nThis gun\\'s for hire\\nEven if we\\'re just dancing in the dark\\nEven if we\\'re just dancing in the dark\\nEven if we\\'re just dancing in the dark\\nEven if we\\'re just dancing in the dark\\nHey baby Well, it seems like I\\'m caught up in your trap again\\nAnd it seems like I\\'ll be wearing the same old chains\\nGood will conquer evil and the truth will set me free\\nAnd I know someday I will find the key\\nAnd I know somewhere I will find the key Well, it seems like I\\'ve been playing your game way too long\\nAnd it seems the game I\\'ve played has made you strong\\nBut when the game is over I won\\'t walk out the loser\\nYeah I know that I\\'ll walk out of here again\\nYeah I know someday I\\'ll walk out of here again But now, I\\'m trapped, oh yeah\\nTrapped, oh yeah\\nTrapped, oh yeah\\nTrapped, oh yeah Now it seems like I\\'ve been sleeping in your bed too long\\nAnd it seems like you\\'ve been meaning to do me harm\\nBut I\\'ll teach my eyes to see, beyond these walls in front of me\\nAnd someday I\\'ll walk out of here again\\nYeah I know someday I\\'ll walk out of here again But now, I\\'m trapped, oh yeah\\nTrapped, oh yeah\\nTrapped, oh yeah\\nTrapped, oh yeah Now it seems like I\\'ve been playing your game way too long\\nAnd it seems the game I\\'ve played has made you strong Because, I\\'m trapped, oh yeah\\nTrapped, oh yeah\\nTrapped, oh yeah\\nTrapped, oh yeah I\\'m trapped, oh yeah\\nTrapped, oh yeah\\nTrapped, oh yeah\\nTrapped, oh yeah\\nI\\'m trapped In the day we sweat it out on the streets of a runaway American dream\\nAt night we ride through the mansions of glory in suicide machines\\nSprung from cages out on highway nine,\\nChrome wheeled, fuel injected,and steppin\\' out over the line\\nH-Oh, Baby this town rips the bones from your back\\nIt\\'s a death trap, it\\'s a suicide rap\\nWe gotta get out while we\\'re young\\n`Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run Yes, girl we were Wendy let me in I wanna be your friend\\nI want to guard your dreams and visions\\nJust wrap your legs \\'round these velvet rims\\nAnd strap your hands \\'cross my engines\\nTogether we could break this trap\\nWe\\'ll run till we drop, baby we\\'ll never go back\\nH-Oh, Will you walk with me out on the wire\\n`Cause baby I\\'m just a scared and lonely rider\\nBut I gotta know how it feels\\nI want to know if love is wild\\nBabe I want to know if love is real Oh, can you show me Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard\\nGirls comb their hair in rearview mirrors\\nAnd the boys try to look so hard\\nThe amusement park rises bold and stark\\nKids are huddled on the beach in a mist\\nI wanna die with you Wendy on the street tonight\\nIn an everlasting kiss One, two, three, four! The highway\\'s jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive\\nEverybody\\'s out on the run tonight\\nBut there\\'s no place left to hide\\nTogether Wendy we can live with the sadness\\nI\\'ll love you with all the madness in my soul\\nH-Oh, Someday girl I don\\'t know when\\nWe\\'re gonna get to that place\\nWhere we really wanna go\\nAnd we\\'ll walk in the sun\\nBut till then tramps like us\\nBaby we were born to run Oh honey, tramps like us\\nBaby we were born to run Come on with me, tramps like us\\nBaby we were born to run Men walking \\'long the railroad tracks\\nGoing someplace, there\\'s no going back\\nHighway patrol choppers coming up over the ridge\\nHot soup on a campfire under the bridge\\nShelter line stretching \\'round the corner\\nWelcome to the new world order\\nFamilies sleeping in the cars in the southwest\\nNo home, no job, no peace, no rest Well the highway is alive tonight\\nBut nobody\\'s kidding nobody about where it goes\\nI\\'m sitting down here in the campfire light\\nSearching for the ghost of Tom Joad He pulls a prayer book out of his sleeping bag\\nPreacher lights up a butt and he takes a drag\\nWaiting for when the last shall be first and the first shall be last\\nIn a cardboard box \\'neath the underpass\\nYou got a one-way ticket to the promised land\\nYou got a hole in your belly and a gun in your hand\\nSleeping on a pillow of solid rock\\nBathing in the city\\'s aqueduct Go! Well the highway is alive tonight\\nWhere it\\'s headed everybody knows\\nI\\'m sitting down here in the campfire light\\nWaiting on the ghost of Tom Joad Now Tom said, \"Mom, wherever there\\'s a cop beating a guy\\nWherever a hungry newborn baby cries\\nWhere there\\'s a fight against the blood and hatred in the air\\nLook for me, Mom, I\\'ll be there Wherever somebody\\'s fighting for a place to stand\\nOr a decent job or a helping hand\\nWherever somebody\\'s struggling to be free\\nLook in their eyes, Ma, and you\\'ll see me\"\\nYeah! The highway is alive tonight\\nWhere it\\'s headed everybody knows\\nI\\'m sitting down here in the campfire light\\nWith the ghost of old Tom Joad It\\'s rainin\\' but there ain\\'t a cloud in the sky\\nMusta been a tear from your eye\\nEverything\\'ll be okay\\nFunny thought I felt a sweet summer breeze\\nMusta been you sighin\\' so deep\\nDon\\'t worry we\\'re gonna find a way I\\'m

the clouds away\\nWaitin\\' on a sunny day Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat\\nIn the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat\\nWith a boulder on my shoulder, feelin\\' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-round\\nWith this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing, the calliope crashed to the ground\\nSome all-hot half-shot was headin\\' for the hot spot, snappin\\' his fingers, clappin\\' his hands\\nAnd some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover\\'s knot with a whatnot in her hand\\nAnd now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws his lover in the sand\\nAnd some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers, daddy\\'s within earshot, save the buckshot, turn up the band And she was blinded by the light\\nOh cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night\\nBlinded by the light\\nShe got down but she never got tight, but she\\'ll make it alright Some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the East\\nHe says, dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that\\'s where they expect it least\\nAnd some new-mown chaperone was standin\\' in the corner all alone, watchin\\' the young girls dance\\nAnd some fresh-sown moonstone was messin\\' with his frozen zone to remind him of the feeling of romance Yeah, he was blinded by the light\\nOh, cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night\\nBlinded by the light\\nHe got down but he never got tight, but he\\'s gonna make it tonight Some silicone sister with her manager\\'s mister told me I got what it takes\\nShe said, I\\'ll turn you on, sonny, to something strong if you play that song with the funky break\\nAnd Go-Cart Mozart was checkin\\' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to go outside\\nAnd little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a ride\\nOh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer, playin\\' backyard bombardier\\nYes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling card, he said, do what you like, but don\\'t do it here\\nWell, I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground and asked him which was the way back home\\nHe said, take a right at the light, keep goin\\' straight until night, and then, boy, you\\'re on your own\\nAnd now in Zanzibar, a shootin\\' star was ridin\\' in a side car, hummin\\' a lunar tune\\nYes, and the avatar said, blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we\\'re gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon\\nAnd some kidnapped handicap was complainin\\' that he caught the clap from some mousetrap he bought last night\\nWell, I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw a gap but figured he\\'d be all right He was just blinded by the light\\nCut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night\\nBlinded by the light\\nMama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun\\nOh, but Mama, that\\'s where the fun is\\nOoh yeah\\nI was blinded\\nI was blinded\\nI was blinded\\nI was blinded\\nI was blinded\\nI was blinded\\nI was blinded\\nI was blinded Hey little girl is your daddy home\\nDid he go away and leave you all alone, mmm mmm\\nI got a

my head\\nOnly you, can cool my desire\\nOh, ho ho, I\\'m on fire\\nOh, ho ho, I\\'m on fire\\nOh, ho ho, I\\'m on fire Woo ooo ooo\\nWoo ooo\\nOoo ooo ooo\\nWoo ooo ooo\\nWoo ooo ooo I had a friend

Janey\\'s fingers were in the cake\\nI think I really dug her \\'cause I was too loose to fake\\nI said, I\\'m hurt, she said, honey, let me heal it\\nAnd we danced all night to a soul fairy

you\\nSpirit in the night (all night), in the night (all night)\\nStand right up and let her shoot through me Now, the night was bright and the stars threw light\\nOn Billy and Davy dancin\\' in the

shirt\\nMe and Crazy Janey was makin\\' love in the dirt\\nSingin\\' our birthday songs\\nJaney said it was time to go\\nSo we closed our eyes and said goodbye to Gypsy Angel Row\\nFelt so

\\'Cause we made a promise we swore we\\'d always remember\\nNo retreat, baby, no surrender\\nBlood brothers in the stormy night\\nWith a vow to defend\\nNo retreat, baby, no surrender Now on the street tonight the lights grow dim\\nThe walls of my room are closing in\\nThere\\'s a war outside still raging\\nYou say it ain\\'t ours anymore to win\\nI want to sleep beneath\\nPeaceful skies in my lover\\'s bed\\nWith a wide open country in my eyes\\nAnd these romantic dreams in my head Once we made a promise we swore we\\'d always remember\\nNo retreat, baby, no surrender\\nBlood brothers in a stormy night\\nWith a vow to defend\\nNo retreat, baby, no surrender\\nNo retreat, baby, no surrender Ohh ohh ohh\\nOhh ohh ohh\\nOhh ohh ohh\\nOhh ohh ohh Here in north east Ohio\\nBack in eighteen-o-three\\nJames and Danny Heaton\\nFound the ore that was linin\\' yellow creek\\nThey built a blast furnace\\nHere along the shore\\nAnd they made the cannon balls\\nThat helped the union

from world war two\\nNow the yards just scrap and rubble\\nHe said, \"Them big boys did what Hitler couldn\\'t do\"\\nThese mills they built the tanks and bombs\\nThat won this country\\'s wars\\nWe sent our sons to Korea and Vietnam\\nNow we\\'re wondering what they were dyin\\' for Here in Youngstown\\nHere in Youngstown\\nMy sweet Jenny, I\\'m sinkin\\' down\\nHere darlin\\' in Youngstown From the Monongaleh valley\\nTo the Mesabi iron range\\nTo the coal mines of Appalacchia\\nThe story\\'s always the same\\nSeven-hundred tons of metal a day\\nNow sir you tell me the world\\'s

Magic Rat drove his sleek machine\\nOver the Jersey state line\\nBarefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge\\nDrinking warm beer in the soft summer rain\\nThe Rat pulls into town, rolls up his pants\\nTogether they take a stab at romance\\nAnd disappear down Flamingo Lane Well, the Maximum Lawmen run down Flamingo\\nChasing the Rat and the barefoot girl\\nAnd the kids \\'round there live just like shadows\\nAlways quiet, holding hands\\nFrom the churches to the jails\\nTonight all is silence in the world\\nAs we take our stand\\nDown in Jungleland The midnight gang\\'s assembled\\nAnd picked a rendezvous for the night\\nThey\\'ll meet \\'neath that giant Exxon sign\\nThat brings this fair city light\\nMan, there\\'s an opera out on the Turnpike\\nThere\\'s a ballet being fought out in the alley\\nUntil the local cops, Cherry-Tops, rips this holy night\\nThe street\\'s alive as secret debts are paid\\nContacts made, they flash unseen\\nKids flash guitars just like switchblades\\nHustling for the record machine\\nThe hungry and the hunted\\nExplode into rock \\'n\\' roll bands\\nThat face off against each other out in the street\\nDown in Jungleland In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage\\nInside the backstreet girls are dancing\\nTo the records that the DJ plays\\nLonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners\\nDesperate as the night moves on\\nJust one look and a whisper, and they\\'re gone Beneath the city, two hearts beat\\nSoul engines running through a night so tender\\nIn a bedroom locked in whispers\\nOf soft refusal and then surrender\\nIn the tunnels uptown, the Rat\\'s own dream guns him down\\nAs shots echo down them hallways in the night\\nNo one watches when the ambulance pulls away\\nOr as the girl shuts out the bedroom light Outside the street\\'s on fire in a real death waltz\\nBetween what\\'s flesh and what\\'s fantasy\\nAnd the poets down here don\\'t write nothing at all\\nThey just stand back and let it all be\\nAnd in the quick of a knife, they reach for their moment\\nAnd try to make an honest stand\\nBut they wind up wounded, not even dead\\nTonight in Jungleland I\\'ve been working real hard, trying to get my hands clean\\nWe\\'ll drive that dusty road from Monroe to Angeline\\nTo buy you a gold ring and pretty dress of blue\\nBaby just one kiss will get these things for you\\nA kiss to seal our fate tonight A kiss to prove it all night\\nProve it all night\\nGirl there\\'s nothing else that we can do\\nSo prove it all night\\nProve it all night\\nAnd girl I\\'ll prove it all night for you Everybody\\'s got a hunger, a hunger they can\\'t resist\\nThere\\'s so much that you want, you deserve much more than this\\nBut if dreams came true, oh, wouldn\\'t that be nice\\nBut this ain\\'t no dream we\\'re living through tonight\\nGirl, you want it, you take it, you pay the price Prove it all night\\nProve it all night\\nProve it all night girl and call the bluff\\nWe\\'ll prove it all night\\nProve it all night\\nGirl I\\'ll prove it all night for your love Baby, tie your hair back in a long white bow\\nMeet me in the fields out behind the dynamo\\nYou hear their voices telling you not to go\\nThey\\'ve made their choices and they\\'ll never know\\nWhat it means to steal, to cheat, to lie\\nWhat it\\'s like to live and die Prove it all night\\nProve it all night\\nGirl there\\'s nothing else that we can do\\nSo prove it all night\\nProve it all night\\nAnd girl I\\'ll prove it all night for you I\\'ll prove it all night\\nI\\'ll prove it all night\\nI\\'ll prove it all night\\nI\\'ll prove it all night\\nI\\'ll prove it all night\\nI\\'ll prove it all night\\nI\\'ll prove it all night\\nI\\'ll prove it all night Spread out now Rosie,

Except roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair Well, the night\\'s busting open, these two lanes will take us anywhere We got one last chance to make it real To trade in these wings on some wheels Climb in back, heaven\\'s waiting on down the tracks Oh oh, come take my hand We\\'re riding out tonight to case the promised land Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road Oh, Thunder Road, oh, Thunder Road Lying out there like a killer in the sun Hey, I know it\\'s late, we can make it if we run Oh oh oh oh, Thunder Road Sit tight, take hold, Thunder Road Well, I got this guitar and I learned how to make it talk And my car\\'s out back if you\\'re ready to take that long walk From your front porch to my front seat The door\\'s open but the ride ain\\'t free And I know you\\'re lonely for words that I ain\\'t spoken But tonight we\\'ll be free, all the promises\\'ll be broken There were ghosts in the eyes of all the boys you sent away They haunt this dusty beach road in the skeleton frames of burned-out Chevrolets They scream your name at night in the street Your graduation gown lies in rags at their feet And in the lonely cool before dawn You hear their engines rolling on But when you get to the porch, they\\'re gone on the wind So Mary, climb in It\\'s a town full of losers, I\\'m pulling out of here to win I get up in the evening And I ain\\'t got nothing to say I

this morning my house was cold Checked out the furnace she wasn\\'t burnin\\' Went out and hoped in my old Ford Hit the engine but she ain\\'t turnin\\' We\\'ve given each other some hard lessons lately But we ain\\'t learnin\\' We\\'re the same sad story that\\'s a fact One step up and two steps back Bird on a wire outside my motel room But he ain\\'t singin\\' Girl in white outside a church in June But the church bells they ain\\'t ringing I\\'m sittin\\' here in this bar tonight But all I\\'m thinkin\\' is I\\'m the same old story same old act One step up and two steps back It\\'s the same thing night on night Who\\'s wrong baby who\\'s right Another fight and I slam the door on Another battle in our dirty little war When I look at myself I don\\'t see The man I wanted to be Somewhere along the line I slipped off track I\\'m caught movin\\' one step up and two steps back There\\'s a girl across the bar I get the message she\\'s sendin\\' Mmm she ain\\'t lookin\\' to married And me well honey I\\'m pretending Last night I dreamed I held you in my arms The music was never-ending We danced as the evening sky faded to black One step up and two steps back Last night I dreamed that I was a child Out where the pines grow wild and tall I was trying to make it home through the forest Before the darkness falls I heard the wind rustling through the trees And ghostly voices rose from the fields I ran with my heart pounding down that broken path With the devil snapping at my heels I broke through the trees and there in the night My father\\'s house stood shining hard and bright The branches and brambles tore my clothes and scratched my arms But I ran till I fell shaking in his arms I awoke and I imagined, the hard things that pulled us apart Will never again, sir, tear us from each other\\'s hearts I got dressed and to that house I did ride From out on the road I could see its windows shining in light I walked up the steps and stood on the porch A woman I didn\\'t recognize came and spoke to me through a chained door I told her my story and who I\\'d come for She said \"I\\'m sorry son but no one by that name lives here anymore\" My father\\'s house shines hard and bright It stands like a beacon calling me in the night Calling and calling, so cold and alone Shining \\'cross this dark highway where our sins lie unatoned Well you don\\'t like, don\\'t like the way I walk And you don\\'t like, don\\'t like the way I talk You criticize about me endlessly Logic defies how you get stuck with me And you complain about the clothes I wear And you explain there\\'s other boys out there You complain my car makes too much noise And you cry I\\'m always out with the boys Whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa) I give up little darling (whoa whoa little darling) Yeah no matter what I do, girl you know it\\'s true Ain\\'t good enough for you You complain the way I love you at night You explain I\\'m really not your type If we go out, you say I\\'m such a bore If we stay in, you say what are we living for I don\\'t understand, there\\'s nothing I can do There ain\\'t no way I can satisfy you End of the night I lean in for a kiss Here comes the pitch, a swing and a miss Whoa whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa) I quit little darling (whoa whoa little darling) Yeah no matter what I do, well you know it\\'s true Ain\\'t good enough for you, hey! Hey! (Come on boys!) Whoa whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa) Hey hey little darling (whoa whoa little darling) No matter what I do, girl you know it\\'s true Ain\\'t good enough for you I tried to change, I got a job in sales I bought a shirt uptown in Bloomindales And babe I tried to make the latest scene Hitting cool just like Jimmy Iovine I bought a record with all the latest grooves A book of love with all the latest moves I bought some flowers and I waited at your door And you came out, didn\\'t want to see me no more Whoa whoa whoa (whoa whoa whoa whoa) I quit little darling (whoa whoa little darling) Yeah no matter what I do, girl you know it\\'s true Ain\\'t good enough for you Hey! Hey! Hey! No matter what I do, girl you know it\\'s true Ain\\'t good enough for you Aww no matter what I do, girl you know it\\'s true Ain\\'t good enough for you Whoaaa! We played king of the mountain out on the end The world come chargin\\' up the hill, and we were women and men Now there\\'s so much that time, time and memory fade away We got our own roads to ride and chances we gotta take We stood side by side each one fightin\\' for the other We said until we died we\\'d always be blood brothers Now the hardness of this world slowly grinds your dreams away Makin\\' a fool\\'s joke out of the promises we make And what once seemed black and white turns to so many shades of gray We lose ourselves in work to do and bills to pay And it\\'s a ride, ride, ride, and there ain\\'t much cover With no one runnin\\' by your side my blood brother On through the houses of the dead past those fallen in their tracks Always movin\\' ahead and never lookin\\' back Now I don\\'t know how I feel, I don\\'t know how I feel tonight If I\\'ve fallen \\'neath the wheel, if I\\'ve lost or I\\'ve gained sight I don\\'t even know why, I don\\'t know why I made this call Or if any of this matters anymore after all But the stars are burnin\\' bright like some mistery uncovered I\\'ll keep movin\\' through the dark with you in my heart My blood brother Do you still say your prayers little darlin\\' Do you go to bed at night Prayin\\' that tomorrow, everything will be alright But tomorrow\\'s fall in number In number one by one You wake up and you\\'re dying You don\\'t even know what from Well they shot you point blank You been shot in the back Baby point blank you been fooled this time Little girl that\\'s a fact Right between the eyes, baby, point blank Right between the pretty lies that they tell Little girl you fell You grew up where young girls they grow up fast You took what you were handed and left behind what was asked But what they asked baby wasn\\'t right You didn\\'t have to live that life I was gonna be your Romeo you were gonna be my Juliet These days you don\\'t wait on Romeos You wait on that welfare check And on all the pretty things that you can\\'t ever have And on all the promises That always end up point blank Shot between the eyes Oh, point blank Like little white lies you tell to ease the pain You\\'re walkin\\' in the sights, girl of point blank And it\\'s one false move and baby the lights go out Once I dreamed we were together again Baby you and me Back home in those old clubs the way we used to be We were standin\\' at the bar It was hard to hear The band was playin\\' loud and you were shoutin\\' somethin\\' in my ear You pulled my jacket off and as the drummer counted four You grabbed my hand and pulled me out on the floor You just stood there and held me, then you started dancin\\' slow And as I pulled you tighter I swore I\\'d never let you go Well I saw you last night down on the avenue Your face was in the shadows but I knew that it was you You were standin\\' in the doorway out of the rain You didn\\'t answer when I called out your name You just turned, and then you looked away Like just another stranger waitin\\' to get blown away Point blank Right between the eyes Oh, point blank Right between the pretty lies you fell Point blank Shot straight through the heart Yeah point blank You\\'ve been twisted up \\'til you\\'ve become just another part of it Point blank, you\\'re walkin\\' in the sights Point blank Livin\\' one false move just one false move away Point blank They caught you in their sights Point blank Did you forget how to love Girl, did you forget how to fight Point blank They must have shot you in the head \\'Cause point blank Bang bang baby you\\'re dead Woke up this morning, was a chill in the air Went into the kitchen, your cigarettes were lying there Your jacket hung on the chair where you left it last night Everything was in place, everything was all right But you were missing Missing... Last night I dreamed the sky went black You were drifting down and you couldn\\'t get back You were lost and in trouble so far from home I reached for you, my arms went to stone I woke and you were missing Missing... I searched for something to explain In the whispering rain, the trembling leaves Tell me baby where did you go You were here just a moment ago There\\'s nights I still hear your footsteps fall Your key in the door, your voice in the hall Your smell drifts through our bedroom I wake, but I don\\'t move With her killer graces and her secret places that no boy can fill With her hands on her hips, oh, and that smile on her lips because she knows that it kills me With her soft French cream, standing in that doorway like a dream, I wish she\\'d just leave me alone Because French cream won\\'t soften them boots and French kisses will not break that heart of stone With her long hair falling and her eyes that shine like a midnight sun Whoa-oh, she\\'s the one She\\'s the one That thunder in your heart at night when you\\'re kneeling in the dark, it say\\'s you\\'re never gonna leave her But there\\'s this angel in her eyes that tells such desperate lies and all you want to do is believe her And tonight you\\'ll try just one more time to leave it all behind and to break on through Oh, she can take you, but if she wants to break you, she\\'s gonna find out that ain\\'t so easy to do And no matter where you sleep tonight or how far you run Whoa-oh, she\\'s the one She\\'s the one Oh oh, and just one kiss, she\\'s fill them long summer nights with her tenderness That secret pact you made, back when her love could save you from the bitterness Oh, she\\'s the one Oh, she\\'s the one Oh, she\\'s the one Oh, she\\'s the one Oh, she\\'s the one Oh, she\\'s the one In my dreams our love was lost. I lived by luck and faith. I carried you inside of me, prayed it wouldn\\'t be too late. Now i\\'m standing on this empty road, where nothing moves but the wind. And honey I just wanna be Back in your arms, back in your arms again. Back in your arms, back in your arms again Oh once I was your treasure, and I saw your face in every star. But these promises we make at night, oh that\\'s all they are. Unless we fill them with faith and love they\\'re empty as a howlin\\' wind. And honey I just wanna be Back in your arms, back in your arms again.. Back in your arms, back in your arms again. Back in your arms, back in your arms again. You came to me with love and kindness, but all my life I\\'ve been a prisoner of my own blindness. I met you with indifference, and I don\\'t know why. Now I wake from my dream, I wake from my dream to this world. Where all the shadow and darkness and above me a dark sky unfurls. And all the love I\\'ve thrown away and lost, I\\'m longing for again. Now darling I just wanna be Back in your arms, back in your arms again. Back in your arms, back in your arms again. Back in your arms, back in your arms again. Back in your arms Every day here you come walking I hold my tongue, I don\\'t do much talking You say you\\'re happy and you\\'re doin\\' fine Well go ahead, baby, I got plenty of time Sad eyes never lie Sad eyes never lie Well for a while I\\'ve been watching you steady Ain\\'t gonna move \\'til you\\'re good and ready You show up and then you shy away But I know pretty soon you\\'ll be walkin\\' this way Sad eyes never lie Sad eyes never lie Baby don\\'t you know I don\\'t care Don\\'t you know that I\\'ve been there Well if something in the air feels a little unkind Don\\'t worry darling, it\\'ll slip your mind I know you think you\\'d never be mine Well that\\'s okay, baby, I don\\'t mind That shy smile\\'s sweet, that\\'s a fact Go ahead, I don\\'t mind the act Here you come all dressed up for a date Well one more step and it\\'ll be too late Blue blue ribbon in your hair Like you\\'re so sure I\\'ll be standing here I\\'ve got a mule and her name is Sal Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal She\\'s a good old worker and a good old pal Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal We haul\\'d some barges in our day Filled with lumber, coal and hay We know every inch of the way From Albany to Bufallo Low bridge, ev\\'rybody down Low bridge, we\\'re coming to a town You\\'ll always know your neighbour And you\\'ll always know your pal If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal We\\'d better look around for a job, old gal Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal You can bet your life I\\'ll never part Sal Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal Get up mule, here comes a lock We\\'ll make Rome \\'bout six o\\'clock One more trip and we\\'ll go Right back home to Buffalo Low bridge, ev\\'rybody down Low bridge, we\\'re coming to a town You\\'ll always know your neighbour And you\\'ll always know your pal If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal Where would I be if I lost my pal?

drummer sound I can feel my heart begin to pound You say you\\'re tired and you just want to close your eyes And follow your dreams down Well, we made a promise we swore we\\'d always remember No retreat, baby, no surrender Like soldiers in the winter\\'s night With a vow to defend No retreat, baby, no surrender Well, now young faces grow sad and old And hearts of fire grow cold We swore blood brothers against the wind Now I\\'m ready to grow young again And hear your sister\\'s voice calling us home Across the open yards Well maybe we\\'ll cut someplace of our own With these drums and these guitars \\'Cause we made a promise we swore we\\'d always remember No retreat, baby, no surrender Blood brothers in the stormy night With a vow to defend No retreat, baby, no surrender Now on the street tonight the lights grow dim The walls of my room are closing in There\\'s a war outside still raging You say it ain\\'t ours anymore to win I want to sleep beneath Peaceful skies in my lover\\'s bed With a wide open country in my eyes And these romantic dreams in my head Once we made a promise we swore we\\'d always remember No retreat, baby, no surrender Blood brothers in a stormy night With a vow to defend No retreat, baby, no surrender No retreat, baby, no surrender Ohh ohh ohh Ohh ohh ohh Ohh ohh ohh Ohh ohh ohh Here in north east Ohio Back in eighteen-o-three James and Danny Heaton Found the ore that was linin\\' yellow creek They built a blast furnace Here along the shore And they made the cannon balls That helped the union win the war Here in Youngstown Here in Youngstown My sweet Jenny, I\\'m sinkin\\' down Here darlin\\' in Youngstown Well my daddy worked the furnaces Kept \\'em hotter than hell I come home from \\'Nam worked my way to scarfer A job that\\'d suit the devil as well Taconite, coke and limestone Fed my children and made my pay Then smokestacks reachin\\' like the arms of god Into a beautiful sky of soot and clay Here in Youngstown Here in Youngstown My sweet Jenny, I\\'m sinkin\\' down Here darlin\\' in Youngstown Well my daddy come on the 0hio works When he come home from world war two Now the yards just scrap and rubble He said, \"Them big boys did what Hitler couldn\\'t do\" These mills they built the tanks and bombs That won this country\\'s wars We sent our sons to Korea and Vietnam Now we\\'re wondering what they were dyin\\' for Here in Youngstown Here in Youngstown My sweet Jenny, I\\'m sinkin\\' down Here darlin\\' in Youngstown From the Monongaleh valley To the Mesabi iron range To the coal mines of Appalacchia The story\\'s always the same Seven-hundred tons of metal a day Now sir you tell me the world\\'s changed Once I made you rich enough Rich enough to forget my name In Youngstown In Youngstown My sweet Jenny, I\\'m sinkin\\' down Here darlin\\' in Youngstown When I die I don\\'t want no part of heaven I would not do heavens work well I pray the devil comes and takes me To stand in the fiery furnaces of hell The Rangers had a homecoming In Harlem late last night And the Magic Rat drove his sleek machine Over the Jersey state line Barefoot girl sitting on the hood of a Dodge Drinking warm beer in the soft summer rain The Rat pulls into town, rolls up his pants Together they take a stab at romance And disappear down Flamingo Lane Well, the Maximum Lawmen run down Flamingo Chasing the Rat and the barefoot girl And the kids \\'round there live just like shadows Always quiet, holding hands From the churches to the jails Tonight all is silence in the world As we take our stand Down in Jungleland The midnight gang\\'s assembled And picked a rendezvous for the night They\\'ll meet \\'neath that giant Exxon sign That brings this fair city light Man, there\\'s an opera out on the Turnpike There\\'s a ballet being fought out in the alley Until the local cops, Cherry-Tops, rips this holy night The street\\'s alive as secret debts are paid Contacts made, they flash unseen Kids flash guitars just like switchblades Hustling for the record machine The hungry and the hunted Explode into rock \\'n\\' roll bands That face off against each other out in the street Down in Jungleland In the parking lot the visionaries dress in the latest rage Inside the backstreet girls are dancing To the records that the DJ plays Lonely-hearted lovers struggle in dark corners Desperate as the night moves on Just one look and a whisper, and they\\'re gone Beneath the city, two hearts beat Soul engines running through a night so tender In a bedroom locked in whispers Of soft refusal and then surrender In the tunnels uptown, the Rat\\'s own dream guns him down As shots echo down them hallways in the night No one watches when the ambulance pulls away Or as the girl shuts out the bedroom light Outside the street\\'s on fire in a real death waltz Between what\\'s flesh and what\\'s fantasy And the poets down here don\\'t write nothing at all They just stand back and let it all be And in the quick of a knife, they reach for their moment And try to make an honest stand But they wind up wounded, not even dead Tonight in Jungleland I\\'ve been working real hard, trying to get my hands clean We\\'ll drive that dusty road from Monroe to Angeline To buy you a gold ring and pretty dress of blue Baby just one kiss will get these things for you A kiss to seal our fate tonight A kiss to prove it all night Prove it all night Girl there\\'s nothing else that we can do So prove it all night Prove it all night And girl I\\'ll prove it all night for you Everybody\\'s got a hunger, a hunger they can\\'t resist There\\'s so much that you want, you deserve much more than this But if dreams came true, oh, wouldn\\'t that be nice But this ain\\'t no dream we\\'re living through tonight Girl, you want it, you take it, you pay the price Prove it all night Prove it all night Prove it all night girl and call the bluff We\\'ll prove it all night Prove it all night Girl I\\'ll prove it all night for your love Baby, tie your hair back in a long white bow Meet me in the fields out behind the dynamo You hear their voices telling you not to go They\\'ve made their choices and they\\'ll never know What it means to steal, to cheat, to lie What it\\'s like to live and die Prove it all night Prove it all night Girl there\\'s nothing else that we can do So prove it all night Prove it all night And girl I\\'ll prove it all night for you I\\'ll prove it all night I\\'ll prove it all night I\\'ll prove it all night I\\'ll prove it all night I\\'ll prove it all night I\\'ll prove it all night I\\'ll prove it all night I\\'ll prove it all night Spread out now Rosie, doctor come cut loose her mama\\'s reins You know playin\\' blind man\\'s bluff is a little

went into a local bar He bought a drink and found a seat in a corner off the dark Well she called up her mama to make sure the kids were out of the house She checked herself out in the dining room mirror And undid an extra button on her blouse He felt her lying next to him, the clock said 4:00 am He was staring at the ceiling He couldn\\'t move his hands  Oh mama mama mama come quick I\\'ve got

His mama said \"Johnny oh Johnny, I\\'m so glad to have you back with me\" His pa said he was sure they\\'d give him his job back down at the factory  Well deep in a dark forest, a forest filled with rain Beyond a stretch of Maryland pines there\\'s a river without a name In the cold black water Johnson Lineir stands He stares across the lights of the city and dreams of where he\\'s been  I was

bring her toys When I come knocking, she smiles pretty, she knows I want to be Candy\\'s boy There\\'s a sadness hidden in that pretty face A sadness all her own From which no man can keep Candy safe

eyes She says, baby if you want to be wild You got a lot to learn, close your eyes Let them melt, let them fire Let them burn \\'Cause in the darkness, there\\'ll be hidden worlds that shine When I hold Candy close she makes the hidden worlds mine She has fancy clothes and diamond rings She has men who give her anything she wants, but they don\\'t see That what she wants is me Oh, and I want her so I\\'ll never let her go, no, no, no She knows that I\\'d give All that I got to give All that I want, all that I live To make Candy mine Tonight She\\'ll let you in her house If you come knockin\\' late at night She\\'ll let you in her mouth If the words you say are right If you pay the price She\\'ll let you deep inside But there\\'s a secret garden she hides She\\'ll let you in her car To go drivin\\' round She\\'ll let you into the parts of herself That\\'ll bring you down She\\'ll let you in herheart If you got a hammer and a vise But into her secret garden, don\\'t think twice You\\'ve gone a million miles How far\\'d you get To that place where You can\\'t remember And you can\\'t forget She\\'ll lead you down a path There\\'ll be tenderness in the air She\\'ll let you come just far enough So you know she\\'s really there She\\'ll look at you and smile And her eyes will say She\\'s got a secret garden Where everything you want Where everything you need Will always stay A million miles away You stare in the mirror at the lines in your face And you try so hard to see The way things were when we were at your place Everyday was just you and me And you cry because things ain\\'t like before Well, don\\'t you know it can\\'t be that way anymore But don\\'t worry baby \\'cause I can\\'t talk now, I\\'m not alone So put your ear close to the phone \\'cause this is the last dance, the last chance For hearts of stone If there was something, baby, That I could do, Something that would last, honey, I would But you should know better than to think that you Can return to the past So close your eyes and I\\'ll be there Hold you once more and not go anywhere I wish I could babe But I can\\'t talk now, I\\'m not alone So put your ear close to the phone \\'cause this is the last dance, the last chance For hearts of stone And you cry because things get so strange so fast And you cry because nothing good ever lasts Well, I know babe But I can\\'t talk now, I\\'m not alone So put your ear close to the phone \\'cause this is the last dance, the last chance For hearts of stone I can\\'t talk now, I\\'m not alone So put your ear close to the phone \\'cause this is the last dance, the last chance For hearts of stone I went out walking the other day Seen a little girl crying along the way She\\'d been hurt so bad said she\\'d never love again Some day your crying girl will end And you\\'ll find once again Two hearts are better than one Two hearts girl get the job done Two hearts are better than one Once I spent my time playing tough guy scenes But I was living in a world of childish dreams Someday these childish dreams must end To become a man and grow up to dream again I believe in the end Two hearts are better than one Two hearts girl get the job done Two hearts are better than one Sometimes it might seem like it was planned For you to roam empty-hearted through this land Though the world turns you hard and cold There\\'s one thing mister, that I know That\\'s if you think your heart is stone And that you\\'re rough enough to whip this world alone Alone buddy there ain\\'t no peace of mind That\\'s why I\\'ll keep searching \\'til I find my special one Two hearts are better than one Two hearts girl get the job done Two hearts are better than one Oh, two hearts are better than one Two hearts girl get the job done Two hearts are better than one Woah  They come from everywhere A longing to be free They come to join us here From sea to shining sea And they all have a dream As people always will To be safe and warm In that shining city on the hill Some wanna slam the door Instead of opening the gate Aw, let\\'s turn this thing around Before it gets too late  It\\'s up to me and you Love can conquer hate I know this to be true That\\'s what makes us great  Don\\'t tell me a lie And sell it as a fact I\\'ve been down that road before And I ain\\'t goin\\' back And don\\'t you brag to me That you never read a book I never put my faith In a con man and his crooks I won\\'t follow down that path And tempt the hands of fate Aw, let\\'s turn this thing around Before it gets too late  It\\'s up to me and you Love can conquer hate I know this to be true That\\'s what makes us great In the quiet of the night I lie here wide awake And I ask myself Is there a difference I can make?  It\\'s up to me and you Love can conquer hate I know this to be true That\\'s what makes us great '"
